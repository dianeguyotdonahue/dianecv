				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile content, for many businesses and publications, is a must-have element. Accessing the web through mobile devices has become people’s primary way of connecting to content, as opposed to using their desktops or laptops, and for businesses/website owners, having pages that load quickly and display correctly on smartphones and the like is critical for reaching wide audiences.</p>
<p>Designing for mobile can be a challenge unto itself, but adding to that challenge are hardware limitations inherent to smartphones and similar devices. They have less processing power than computers and many users are further burdened by having limited access to data, spotty networks, etc. Because of this, websites with mobile in mind cannot afford to be resource intensive, as slow pages will deter smartphone users from bothering to access them.</p>
<p>In the quest for mobile dominance, two methodologies emerged as solutions for improving the mobile web experience, with aims of making pages load faster and conserving data usage: Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) and Facebook Instant Articles. Today, we’ll be taking a look at these two competitors, explaining what they are, how they stack up against one another, and what situations you’d want to consider giving them a shot.</p>
<h2>Google AMP And Facebook Instant Articles: The Basics</h2>
<p>The short description of both products is that they help website content, particularly words and pictures, load faster when viewed on mobile devices. You’d want to implement them for your website if you know you’ll have a large base of mobile users, but the way the two platforms are structured and execute on their goal vary, which is what we’ll be taking a look at here.</p>
<h2>Facebook Instant Articles<br />
 <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-318" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FIA-v2@2x-1024x585.png" alt="" width="1024" height="585" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FIA-v2@2x-1024x585.png 1024w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FIA-v2@2x-768x439.png 768w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FIA-v2@2x.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></h2>
<p>Facebook lays out some of the basics of what they’re instant articles are on their FAQ page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Instant Articles is a mobile publishing format that enables news publishers to distribute articles to Facebook&#8217;s app that load and display as much as 10 times faster than the standard mobile web.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a nutshell, this allows content creators to publish their full-length articles through Facebook, on their news feed, as opposed to using links to take readers to another site. Users never have to leave Facebook (and Facebook benefits by getting a potential cut of advertising money). It makes use of some of the same technology Facebook employs to make their photos and videos load faster. As a result, Instant Articles benefits from features like autoplaying videos and the like.</p>
<p>Instant Articles doesn’t require a separate content management system, and using HTML5 to build the articles and either the Instant Articles API or a secure RSS feed, content creators are able to publish their works directly from their own CMS to the Facebook feed, provided they have gone through the process of getting their sample content approved by Facebook beforehand.</p>
<p>The fact that users are staying on Facebook rather than visiting a content creator’s homepage might be seen as a slight drawback, as it could potentially limit advertisers and revenue to what Facebook has available (users can either supply their own ad inventory and keep it all, or cough up a percentage for Facebook and let them do the legwork), but it’s a tradeoff that some are willing to make. In addition to loading more quickly, Instant Articles are more likely to be shared, creating a wider audience for publishers, and those articles are much less likely to be abandoned by readers.</p>
<h2>Google AMP</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-317" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AMP@2x-1024x585.png" alt="" width="1024" height="585" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AMP@2x-1024x585.png 1024w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AMP@2x-768x439.png 768w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AMP@2x.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In contrast to Instant Articles, Google AMP has decided to optimize the mobile web experience instead of push content creators to publish directly their social platform. AMP is supported by a range of platforms, is cross-browser compatible, and, as noted by Wired, achieves increased page loading speeds through two methods:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“First, it requires web developers to use a narrow set of web technologies to create pages. Most JavaScript is forbidden, which, as we’ve noted before, is a really good way to make web pages load faster. Second, it serves pages from its own servers, at least when you visit an AMP page via a Google search.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could think of AMPs as being similar to Instant Articles, except they pop up in the body of search results instead of on a Facebook feed. Creators use the AMP protocols to restructure their site (a distinct concept from simply “optimizing” pages for mobile viewing). This alternate version of the website in question is published by AMP and, when viewed on mobile devices, are smooth and load instantly, greatly improving the user experience.</p>
<p>Increased speed isn’t the only reason that content creators elect to use AMP, however. AMP articles gain eligibility for the “carousel” of results that rest above list results in a Google browser search, which could potentially boost visibility and gain content publishers views. There’s also the benefit of increased engagement from visitors (as sites appear more polished) and more time spent on site, as the enhanced experience is welcoming to mobile users.</p>
<p>Add to that the fact that number of businesses, content creators, etc. who have already jumped on the “AMP bandwagon,” so to speak, and the increased competition for mobile supremacy is enough in and of itself to inspire other website owners to do the same.</p>
<h2>How Google AMP And Facebook Instant Articles Compare</h2>
<p>Both platforms started with the goal of improving the mobile web experience, but, judging by recent news, Google AMP seems to have edged out Facebook Instant Articles in terms of popularity. In January, Digiday reported that Google AMP had been enjoying more widespread adoption, courting larger publishers like Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Flipboard. Instant Articles, on the other hand, had seen better days on that front:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Instant Articles, meanwhile, has fallen out of the conversation as Facebook increasingly prioritizes video over text articles in its news feed. Several prominent publishers, including The New York Times and the Guardian, have stopped using Instant Articles altogether.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which isn’t to say that AMP is perfect. Criticisms of AMP include the fact that there’s limited diversity among the varied templates (meaning that AMP pages all look too similar to be distinguishable), analytics with AMP are more difficult to track, and having AMP URLs display in search (as opposed to original article URLs) can be frustrating to publishers.</p>
<p>On the flipside, though, AMP has traditionally contained more options for sharing content, makes it easier to switch between articles, is an open-source project, and, as such, is constantly under development and incorporating changes to improve the platform. Since Instant Articles is a strictly-Facebook developed project, updates have been less numerous and less profound.</p>
<p>Where Facebook Instant Articles does hit the ball out of the park, though, is in terms of speed. According to Search Engine Watch, while Google AMP does allow mobile pages to load nearly four times faster than they would on standard mobile web, Facebook Instant Articles cand do it even quicker. Unfortunately for Facebook, however, their diminishing number of publishers has only given more ground to Google AMP.</p>
<h2>Putting It Into Practice</h2>
<p>To review, both Facebook Instant Articles and Google AMP help pages load quicker, but their approaches are different and the advantages content publishers might gain from using their platforms vary. With Facebook Instant Articles, articles are published on the Facebook feed and takes advantage of HTML5, but with Google AMP, website owners create a different version of their site that is pared down and fits AMP’s standards so that it will load more quickly.</p>
<p>Facebook Instant Articles enjoy a speed advantage over Google AMP, but in AMP, creators have more control over their articles and a wider base of potential viewership, as the AMP audience is growing (while FIA’s seems to be contracting). For those keen on speed alone, Instant Articles might be the path to take, but for those publishers concerned with control, reaching more readers, and a higher potential for monetization, Google AMP is distinguishing itself as the better bet.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few things are more confusing than vague tech-related jargon. When it comes to DevOps, the phrases <b>Continuous Integration</b>, <b>Continuous Delivery</b>, and <b>Continuous Deployment</b> might well take the cake. It might well be easy to get these similar ideas confused with one another, given some of the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28608015/continuous-integration-vs-continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment">basic definitions</a> for each floating around&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Continuous Integration</b> basically just means that the developer&#8217;s working copies are synchronized with a shared mainline several times a day.</li>
<li><b>Continuous Delivery</b> is described as the logical evolution of continuous integration: Always be able to put a product into production.</li>
<li><b>Continuous Deployment</b> is described as the logical next step after continuous delivery: Automatically deploy the product into production whenever it passes QA.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nebulous descriptions like that make it easy to think the degree of separation between these concepts is inconsequential. Those subtle distinctions make knowing the differences worthwhile, however. In this post, we’re going to cover the meanings of these terms in greater detail, along with what makes each unique and how their variances matter.</p>
<h2><b>Continuous Integration</b></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-305" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/25.01.2018-integration-1024x376.png" alt="" width="1024" height="376" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/25.01.2018-integration-1024x376.png 1024w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/25.01.2018-integration-768x282.png 768w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/25.01.2018-integration.png 1388w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>When practicing Continuous Integration, developers will frequently merge their changes back into the main branch of a shared cache. Instead of building separate features in isolation and incorporating those individual changes into software at the end of a development cycle, multiple developers will integrate their code to the mainline several times throughout their day (under ideal circumstances).</p>
<p>Using a build server specifically designed for automated testing, the changes are put through their paces to catch potential conflicts early on, avoiding the so-called “integration hell” that might occur when attempting to integrate changes mere days before a product is due to release.</p>
<p>Circumventing a situation where software might work on an individual developer’s machine but fails when combined with the code from other developers who are working on different parts of the same project is a boon in and of itself. The benefits, however, go beyond that.</p>
<p>Using a strategy of Continuous Integration can also boost the productivity of individual developers. As they produce code, it is integrated and tested with other developer’s code. By gaining immediate feedback on code and integration errors, they can respond to problems quickly, making necessary corrections before they become larger issues and keeping them in a near-continuous state of progress.</p>
<p>These potential benefits, however, are only a net positive when combined with a degree of automation, however. Simply integrating code does not guarantee a superior product. Those changes must be tested to ensure proper functionality. When organizations use manual methods to ascertain if new code is introducing bugs, tampering with operations, and, in general, is up to standards, Continuous Integration can put a strain on time and resources.</p>
<p>By making use of automation and test suites, the process becomes much more feasible. Instead of manually running the required tests, developers can upload code, then automated processes will handle creating a new software build and testing it for integration errors. Should any problems arise, the dev team will be alerted, allowing them to move swiftly to correct complications before proceeding.</p>
<p>In the end, the idea is to make integration a simple, routine process rather than a nightmare that occurs near the end of a development cycle. The team has the ability to correct programming defects early on, and the overall costs of integration are, as a result, reduced.</p>
<h2><b>Continuous Delivery</b></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-306" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/25.01.2018-delivery--1024x376.png" alt="" width="1024" height="376" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/25.01.2018-delivery--1024x376.png 1024w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/25.01.2018-delivery--768x282.png 768w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/25.01.2018-delivery-.png 1388w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>As the “logical extension of Continuous Integration,” Continuous Delivery incorporates much of the same in its process. The development team is still making and testing frequent changes to the software they are working on, but a new wrinkle is added into the scheme: the software delivery process is also automated, so that dev teams are ready to get their code to production at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>Like Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery relies heavily on automation to ensure it works correctly. You may have well heard of the concept of a deployment pipeline before. It’s the creation of an automated process to get software from version control phases into the hands of users. This additional step is added to the frequent integration and testing of Continuous Integration, so that developers can get their software out quickly while making changes &#8212; should they choose to do so.</p>
<p>That last point is important, because having the option to deploy while they work on upgrading software in smaller chunks is of great benefit to development teams. It allows them to focus and gain feedback on their work more often while simultaneously being able to deliver new features and functionality to their customer base when they are ready. The process also benefits those end users, as they reap the rewards of these changes on a much faster basis.</p>
<p>In traditional “waterfall” methods of development, users of a piece of software could wait months before seeing the fruits of developers’ changes to code. With Continuous Delivery, the process could potentially be cut to days or even hours. Users can provide feedback to a development team on what a product could be lacking and where it might be improved. The developers, in turn, can use a Continuous Delivery scheme to rapidly update and bring such changes to their user base.</p>
<p>The result is a demystification of the software release cycle. Instead of a much ballyhooed affair, it becomes a routine and rather rote procedure, instilling the dev team with greater confidence that they have a quality product, and letting customers enjoy that higher quality product faster than they might have via other methods.</p>
<h2><b>Continuous Deployment</b></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-307" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/25.01.2018-deploy-1024x376.png" alt="" width="1024" height="376" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/25.01.2018-deploy-1024x376.png 1024w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/25.01.2018-deploy-768x282.png 768w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/25.01.2018-deploy.png 1388w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Continuous Deployment has a lot in common with Continuous Delivery. Both processes build on the Continuous Integration idea of frequently weaving and testing code to ensure its ready to go. Both operate on the idea of having product code ready to send to customers as swiftly as possible. Where Continuous Deployment differs from Continuous Delivery, however, is in the fact that software builds are deployed automatically after they undergo testing.</p>
<p>This setup does away with the need for the human decision making that would otherwise go into whether or not to get new, fully tested code out to users, thereby further enhancing the speed of the rollout. It’s important to bear in mind, however, that just because these new software iterations are automatically deployed, that doesn’t mean they are instantaneously activated. Developers can still employ techniques to control when new features become live and which segments of users gain access to them if need be.</p>
<p>Continuous Deployment comes with many of the same benefits that Continuous Delivery does. Dev teams can gain from and respond to user feedback in a rapid manner. This allows them to course correct if they are heading in a sub-optimal direction with a product, and get the software back on track so that it meets user standards. Beyond that, though, the automation of the deployment of software changes to customers reduces confusion over what’s going to the user base and enhances productivity by allowing devs to focus on ever smaller facets of their software.</p>
<p>There is risk, of course, in such a high degree of automation. The seeming lack of control can cause anxiety for some developers who might want to have the final say on when software is pushed out to their users. On the flip side, though, the Continuous Deployment method puts an even greater onus on developers to ensure they follow best practices and maintain that they’re code is well-written, well-tested, and worthy of production on a consistent basis.</p>
<h2><b>Bringing It All Together</b></h2>
<p>Though each methodology differs slightly in nature, there are overarching themes that bind them together. In all three of these software approaches, the emphasis is on speed and manageability. Code is developed in smaller waves to minimize the possibility of integration issues and reduce the time it takes to test for errors. Testing must be performed frequently to ensure that the team is ready to jump to production, and it must all occur daily to keep the development cycle running smoothly. </p>
<p>In spite of the small distinctions between the three individual methods, when done correctly, they help reduce production times and make it so that integration and software deployment goes a swiftly and smoothly as possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3> </h3>
<p>With all the fracas going on in the past few weeks, it’s likely you’ve at least heard a passing mention of the Bitcoin phenomenon. When <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-futures-launch-stokes-fears-of-manipulation-hacks-glitches-1512907201?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_content%3BEDtHCxmYTzm21EgpOwM9EA%3D%3D">Bitcoin futures</a> went live, the investment world went abuzz, and with the price of Bitcoin rising dramatically in the past few months, general interest in the Bitcoin has crept ever-higher. With that in mind, we’d like to dive into some basics, history, and other pertinent details for those who might want to bolster their Bitcoin knowledge and educate themselves on what is currently the world’s most well-known cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>Much of the most elementary information about Bitcoin can be found directly from the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/faq">Bitcoin.org FAQ</a>. While we won’t rehash every bit of information here, we would like to dive into some of the more important points and explore them with slightly greater detail. For instance, What it is and how it works. Here’s a short explanation, taken directly from the Bitcoin.org FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>“Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a completely digital money. It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While succinct, that answer still leaves a bit to be desired by those completely unfamiliar with the concept. To cut through some of the confusion, you’ll first have to get an idea of the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-blockchain-2016-10">technology behind it</a>, a network commonly referred to as a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-bitcoin-the-cryptocurrency-explained-2017-5">blockchain</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>“Blockchain&#8230;is basically an online ledger that keeps a secure record of each transaction all in one place. Every time anyone buys or sells bitcoin, the swap gets logged. Several hundred of these back-and-forths make up a block.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The advantage here is that these blocks are decentralized across all the devices that have Bitcoin wallets, which, in theory, makes it quicker, cheaper, and more reliable as a form of payment. Coindesk breaks the concept down with an easy to understand analogy, highlighting the fact that the decentralized ledger keeps the system honest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>“You can’t cheat it. I can’t send you digital apples [Bitcoin] I don’t have, because then it wouldn’t sync up with everybody else in the system. It’d be a tough system to beat. Especially if it got really big. Plus, it’s not controlled by one person, so I know there’s no one that can just decide to give himself more digital apples. The rules of the system were already defined at the beginning.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another one of those founding rules of the Bitcoin system is that there’s a finite amount: 21 million. As the years roll on, the number of Bitcoin released drops (it cuts in half every four years), and those “mining” Bitcoin receive a diminished reward for doing so. Because of this, the number of discoverable Bitcoin (and total Bitcoin in circulation) will eventually cease growing. This helps guard Bitcoin against inflation, but also raises the question, how do people access gain access to those new Bitcoin in the first place?</p>
<p>The process is known as Bitcoin Mining. There’s some complex math that goes on behind the scenes, but Mother Jones <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/04/what-is-bitcoin-explained/">provides</a> a comprehensible, if simplified, explanation, by way of financial attorney Reuben Grinberg:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><img class="aligncenter wp-image-297 size-full" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Million.png" alt="" width="694" height="255" /><br />
 “Grinberg compares it to finding the missing piece of a puzzle. Whomever finds the puzzle piece wins a certain number of Bitcoins, and the process starts all over again. Finding the Bitcoin solution involves an incredible amount of processing power, and so users often band together in “pools” in order to find the solution and to earn Bitcoins more regularly.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This system, which incorporates blockchain, prevent individuals from scamming by way of attempting to modify blocks, since that would invalidate subsequent blocks. It also creates a “competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the blockchain.” In short, individuals have to play by the rules of the system, else they’re unable to mine any Bitcoin at all.</p>
<p>As for transactions of Bitcoin between different Bitcoin wallet holders, these are all included in the blockchain as well. Each Bitcoin wallet has a “secret” piece of data, referred to as a private key, that enable wallet holders to spend their Bitcoin through a cryptographic signature. They provide a kind of “mathematical proof” of a transaction, adding the wallet holder’s signature to an exchange and preventing others from altering said exchanges once the signature has been issued.</p>
<h2>How Bitcoin Is Used</h2>
<p>Despite being a relatively new technology, Bitcoin has rapidly gained popularity along with utility. Across the world, individuals are using Bitcoin to pay for goods and services, a process which is being made even easier by the increasing level of acceptance of Bitcoin and new services designed to help facilitate its use.</p>
<p>Part of the reasoning behind the rise of Bitcoin are the multiple benefits provided by its use, which, according to Bitcoin.org, include payment freedom, the ability to choose fees, greater security and control, transparency, and a reduced level of risk for merchants. Users can, for instance, send and receive Bitcoin virtually anywhere at any time. They aren’t subject to additional charges levied by other methods of payment, etc.</p>
<p>Because of its decentralized nature and the great deal of freedom it allows users, Bitcoin is oft-scrutinized for its potential to enable illicit activity. Supporters often counter these claims by noting that any form of currency can be used for unscrupulous dealings, and that existing forms of transactions outstrip Bitcoin in their use for criminal purposes. Beyond that, though, they add that Bitcoin has the potential to limit some forms of crime (like fraud) since it is impossible to counterfeit.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin’s History</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-298 aligncenter" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Pizza-Slice.png" alt="" width="694" height="255" /></p>
<p>How did Bitcoin get its start? You can learn a fair bit about its history from Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/12/06/a-short-history-of-bitcoin-and-crypto-currency-everyone-should-read/#493a45433f27">run-down</a> and this <a href="https://futurism.com/images/the-entire-history-of-bitcoin-in-a-single-infographic/">infographic</a> from Futurism. Here are some essentials, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launched in 2009, some of the specifics surrounding Bitcoin’s origins are shrouded in an element of mystery. After the Bitcoin.org domain was registered, a paper, <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"><i>Bitcoin: A-Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System</i></a> was posted detailing the the system and how it was supposed to work. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The originator, “Satoshi Nakamoto,” is believed to be a pseudonym, and the true identity of Bitcoin’s creator is unknown. Multiple attempts to reveal this identity have been made, with the most recent pointing to Australian scholar Craig Steven Wright, but, so far, none of the investigations into Nakamoto’s identity have been conclusive. It could be an individual, or a group, but, regardless they were the first to mine bitcoin — the progenitor who gave it that initial spark.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The first Bitcoin transaction occurred in 2009, between Nakamoto and a programmer, Hal Finney. Services to exchange Bitcoin for other currency (like the infamous MtGox) were established.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2010 saw the first valuation of Bitcoin, when an individual paid 10,000 Bitcoin for two pizzas. As Forbes noted, “If the buyer had hung onto those Bitcoins, at today’s prices they would be worth more than $100 million.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2013 saw a crash in Bitcoin prices, and 2014 brought a wave of scams and theft. In spite of these setbacks, though, Bitcoin usage continued grow, and those prices eventually skyrocketed to their current 2017 peak of $17,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the years since its release, Bitcoin has experienced increasing growth and notoriety. Of the many milestones throughout the Bitcoin saga, however, two of the more recent developments stand out: The Bitcoin Fork and Bitcoin Futures.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin Fork occurred in late 2017, with the creation of Bitcoin Cash. Essentially, it <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-fork-explained-gold-segwit-segwit2x-cash-the-bit-3-2017-10">created a shift</a> in the blockchain rules. While not supplanting the old mining rules that govern Bitcoin, it did create an alternate form of the currency. They have the same “cryptographic credentials,” but, as Ars Technica <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/why-the-bitcoin-network-just-split-in-half-and-why-it-matters/">notes</a>, “very different values if you sell them for old-fashioned dollars.”</p>
<p>The reasoning behind the split arose over the size over the block limits when mining for Bitcoin. Instead of debating in circles, a group of Bitcoin users, the so-called “Big block supporters,” decided to take matters into their own hands and create the rival version of Bitcoin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>“So those miners in Bitcoin Cash from the summer decided that blocks should be much bigger, that every miner should be moving bigger blocks of memory.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-bitcoin-future-2017-12?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_content%3BEDtHCxmYTzm21EgpOwM9EA%3D%3D">Bitcoin Futures</a>, they’ll work like many similar such financial products, allowing investors to bet on the future price of Bitcoin and settle in cash for potential profit. This could, theoretically, “pave the way for an exchange-traded fund,” allowing for more investments in Bitcoin, reducing its volatility, and opening the door for greater participation in Bitcoin trading by Wall Street.</p>
<p>What’s next? 2018 is shaping up to be <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/future-of-bitcoin-blockchain-2018/"><i>The Year Of The Cryptocurrency Craze</i></a>, according to sources like Wired. As the Bitcoin becomes more widespread, competition among Bitcoin services will likely increase, either working out the kinks or falling by the wayside. Even if Bitcoin eventually crashes and burns, though, it seems likely that the idea of cryptocurrency is around to stay, and another challenger might rise to fill the void.</p>

<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/user-testing-website/">User Testing for Your Website</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coaxsoft.com/blog">COAX Software Blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>User Testing for Your Website: How to Understand Your Users and Make Your Product Better<br />
 </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t matter how attractive your website design is, or how well-written the content is, if your site makes it difficult for users to achieve what they want to do. As a result, if you don’t understand your audience, their time spent on your site will decrease and your user base will shrink along with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid this fate, you need to make good usability one of the foremost concerns for your website. In these situations, user testing can help you build a better site for the people who need it the most: your end users.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is User Testing?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When building a website, there are many different testing techniques, each with its own purpose: functionality, security, performance, and so on. These tests are usually carried out by testers, developers, and QA staff who have already been working on the website since the project began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User testing (also known as usability testing) is something different: putting your website in front of real, representative users and getting their feedback. During user testing, your team collects information about how users navigate throughout the website, how well they follow any instructions, and how easily they can complete typical activities on your site. Thorough testers can also discover common website problems such as broken links, errors, and typos.</span></p>
<h2><b>Why is User Testing Important?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, what it really comes down to is this: you need to provide a website that people want to use, and prefer to use over your competitors. The only way to do that is by gathering as much data as you can about how people use your product and what they really think about it. User testing provides the following benefits:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Authentic feedback:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you want to provide an excellent user experience, you can only do so by understanding how real people interact with your website. When it comes to user testing, the old saying that “actions speak louder than words” is very true. Rather than having them fill out endless surveys and questionnaires, user testing measures users’ actual behavior: what actions they take to accomplish their goals and objectives.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>New perspectives:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The features that your development team find important might be completely different from what your users want. By bringing in a fresh pair of eyes from outside the development team to look at your website, you can often expose hidden assumptions and misconceptions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Higher revenue:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Determining what your audience really wants helps you convert more people into customers. In addition, spending time on good design means that your users will feel valued and important, improving retention and boosting your revenues. A 2014 study of design-centric companies found that in the previous 10 years, they outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index by </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2014/04/design-can-drive-exceptional-returns-for-shareholders"><span style="font-weight: 400;">228 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Lower costs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">User testing helps to identify issues with your website before it goes live, which can save you money in support and maintenance. It’s estimated that programmers spend </span><a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/benefits-of-ucd.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 percent of their time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on avoidable “rework.” By fixing flaws and complaints earlier in the development process, you won’t have to spend more money six months or a year later making revisions to your website or even doing a complete overhaul.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>How Should You Conduct User Testing?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first question regarding user testing is: where are you going to find your users? You can use friends and family if necessary, or you can recruit people on websites such as Craigslist, UserTesting.com, and Mechanical Turk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whomever you choose, make sure that their profile fits fairly well with one of the personas that you’ve created. Each persona is a representation of one of the types of users who you expect to visit your website, including information such as age, occupation, and technical proficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During each testing session, you should clearly explain to the user what their objectives are or what activities to perform during this session, and then set them free to interact with the website without providing any guidance. Encourage users to think out loud, vocalizing their thought processes so that you have a better idea of what they’re thinking and expecting. There are no “wrong” thoughts or ideas from the user during these sessions. Any mistakes or failures along the way are a result of the disconnect between the website’s assumptions and users’ objectives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re developing a website in conjunction with a particular product or service, such as a mobile app, it’s often helpful to have the same users test both the product and the website. They can provide feedback on a number of issues, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How well the website supports the product</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether the website and product have the same functionalities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether there are any “missing links” between the website and product</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>What Tools Can You Use for User Testing?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qualitative information such as users’ written and spoken thoughts is incredibly important, but so too is quantitative information about how people use your website. This data can take a number of forms, such as most frequently visited pages, time spent on each page, mouse movements, click heatmaps, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To record this information, a number of useful tools and technologies are available. The list below goes over just a few of the most popular.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.inspectlet.com/"><b>Inspectlet:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This software application records videos of your website’s visitors as they interact with your site. Inspectlet tracks every mouse movement, scroll, and key pressed so that you understand exactly how users behave, what they pay attention to, and what obstacles they face.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.optimizely.com/"><b>Optimizely:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A/B testing is one of the most useful techniques in user testing: presenting each person with one of two design options, and seeing which one users prefer as a collective. Optimizely makes running A/B tests a snap, letting you test multiple variables on a single page and deliver personalized customer experiences.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.usertesting.com/"><b>UserTesting:</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The UserTesting website lets you search for testers who match specific criteria and demographic information. Once you find them, use the platform to run tests and get responses to your questions and surveys. Within an hour, you’ll receive the complete video of users narrating their experience using your site.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.techsmith.com/morae.html"><b>Morae:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you’re doing testing in your offices, TechSmith’s Morae platform is an excellent tool. Morae provides hard data after every user test, and can also capture focus group sessions and testing of mobile devices and hardware.</span></li>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby On Rails</a>—commonly shortened to just Rails, is a powerful cross-platform software framework used widely for developing web applications. Could it also be a suitable platform for implementing various forms of biometric authentication? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As biometrics become more and more ubiquitous for verifying user identities as time goes on, it becomes an ever more important step to integrate such forms of authentication into web-based products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today we&#8217;re going to explore the feasibility of utilizing Rails for biometric authentication, along with a few additional considerations to keep in mind when taking on the task of doing so.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Few Notes On Biometric Authentication</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To properly explore this idea, we&#8217;ll first need to lay out what we mean by &#8220;biometric authentication.&#8221; In short, biometric authentication refers to a user identification/verification process that relies on biological input (the use of some part of the human body). This differs from both knowledge-based authentication (e.g. when a user must input a password or similar piece of information to access a system) and property-based authentication (e.g. when a user must rely on a keycard or other object to gain access).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Advantages Of Biometric Authentication</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it comes with some drawbacks, the advantages of using biometric authentication are still numerous. For starters, biometric authentication is considered one of the most effective forms of authentication currently available. This is because of the biological component. Unique, identifying physical features make them difficult to spoof, and the technology involved in authentication—fingerprint scanners, facial recognition, and the like—are highly accurate.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biometrics Examples</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few examples of biometric markers would include the aforementioned fingerprints and complete face, but might also include the human eye, voice, or even hand geometry. Each individual method of biometric authentication comes with its own set of unique advantages and disadvantages (some eye scanners, for example, can be fooled by high-quality photographs of a user&#8217;s face/eyes). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the whole, though, these forms of biometric authentication are lauded, and being incorporated in more and more pieces of technology. From hardware like smartphones and laptops to software such as web applications and services, the demand for biometrics has increased in recent years and will likely continue to do so as the means of implementing such means of authentication become even more affordable and reliable on a broad scale.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biometrics &amp; Web Services</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefit of using such technology for web services is evident. The quality and reliability of web products are enhanced when they are coupled with high degrees of information security, which is exactly what biometric authentication provides. By ensuring the users of web services are who they claim to be, personal data is protected and risks involved with the theft or abuse of said data are lessened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biometrics increase security by making it more difficult for potential intruders to gather the information they need to bypass safeguards. To have any hope of collecting biometric data from a target, they need to be within physical proximity, putting them at a greater risk of being discovered. If a biometric system is bypassed, the pool of potential suspects is limited to those who have personal access to the user, making the process of narrowing them down much easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the enhanced level of security, though, biometric authentication systems promote a greater ease of use for those utilizing a web-based platform. Just like fingerprint scanners and facial recognition on smartphones allow owners to swiftly and securely access their devices, the same principle can apply to using web applications. Instead of lengthy (and perhaps forgettable) passwords, users can rely on their biology to gain access to the systems and services they desire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, it can be used as a supplementary authentication factor as opposed to being the only one. In addition to a password or some similar knowledge-based piece of authentication, end users might also input their biometric info as an additional layer of security, making it even more difficult to an intruder to scam their way into a system.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Ruby On Rails Comes Into Play</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how does Ruby On Rails fit into this picture? Biometric recognition functionality has the be melded into a web application for it to provide the desired security benefits. Perhaps, for example, you want to implement some sort of facial recognition via webcam, or fingerprint scanning capability, or a combination of biometric systems to allow users access to your online platform. You&#8217;ll need to create code that allows for said integration to occur. Rails is a framework that provides one such option for developing the code required for this task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking the fingerprint scanning example a bit further, Rails can be used to create a system wherein end-users can register their fingerprint information via a fingerprint reader, then have that on file to access a specific web application. Through the internet, the end-users biometric input is read by an identification/authentication server, which has access to the database of registered users. If they&#8217;re &#8220;on the list,&#8221; so to speak, they are then authorized and can carry on with whatever business they intended to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This might be an authorization system of some sort, but could also be used in transaction systems (web platforms where users want to access monetary accounts), points-of-sale (where they may go online to purchase goods) or even time and attendance systems (logging when and where they are working). The uses for biometric authentication aren&#8217;t strictly limited to these options, mind you, but they are some of the most prevalent examples and provide solid examples of how this sort of authentication is most commonly used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The form of biometric input needn&#8217;t be limited to simply fingerprints either. As mentioned, it might also take the form of facial recognition, voice recognition, performing a biometric analysis of a user&#8217;s keyboard input, etc. As Rails is a popular framework for web development, particularly in instances where more complexity is required. It&#8217;s speed, modularity (it&#8217;s possible to integrate various 3rd-party solutions), and ability to allow for the addition of features to web applications (such as biometric authentication) make it a suitable choice for those wishing to include this type of authentication into their web products.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenges To Consider</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because something is possible, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a simple feat for just anyone to achieve. There are a few complexities to bear in mind when trying to implement biometric authentication via web applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Namely, finding a solution that will properly interface with the myriad biometric readers, scanners, and other peripherals used to capture biometric input. Additional concerns might be ensuring that such inputs (and the database in which end-users&#8217; data is stored) are kept secure, among several others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you aren&#8217;t experienced in developing Ruby On Rails apps, working with programmers who are will be paramount to tackling the challenge of using it to add biometric authentication to the web services that you envision. COAX has been working with Rails for years, and our developers are well-suited to the challenges that come with creating code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond that, though, we&#8217;re skilled with every phase of the development process and can assist with testing solutions to ensure they work as intended, along with maintaining them post-launch to patch defects and heighten their functionality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding biometric authentication to your web services is an excellent step towards increasing their security and promoting greater ease for your end users. We&#8217;re available to help support you in achieving that goal. </p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruby on Rails is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a high-quality, highly popular back-end web development framework. By now, the RoR framework has developed into a powerful technology with a number of benefits, including its speed of deployment, pre-built modules and plugins, and user-friendly community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to build an enterprise-strength, outward-facing website with RoR, however, you need a way to provide support to your customers. By making the right choices in terms of customer service, you’ll both keep your existing users happier and turn more people from prospects into loyal converts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From live chat to help desk systems, there are a number of ways that companies can organize support for their Ruby on Rails web applications. Here’s a look at six of your most popular options.</span></p>
<h2><b>Live Chat</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live chat is an essential part of any business website that serves clients in many different locations. According to Ubisend’s </span><a href="https://insights.ubisend.com/2016-mobile-messaging-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 Mobile Messaging Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 51 percent of customers want businesses to be able to respond to them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What’s more, Zendesk’s </span><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/company/press/zendesk-benchmark-live-chat-drives-highest-customer-satisfaction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2015 Benchmark report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that live chat results in the most satisfied customers (92 percent of them), beating other channels such as email, phone, and social media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Ruby on Rails’ strong user community, there are several accessible online tutorials for building RoR live chat applications. Three of them, from </span><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/create-a-chat-app-with-rails-5-actioncable-and-devise/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SitePoint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2016/07/14/building-customer-service-chat-rails-5-action-cable-sms-dr/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexmo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://blog.heroku.com/real_time_rails_implementing_websockets_in_rails_5_with_action_cable"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroku</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, make use of the new Action Cable feature in Rails 5, which allows you to communicate in real time over WebSockets. Another tutorial from </span><a href="http://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/hello-or-building-a-chatting-app-with-rails/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Code Adventure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> development blog uses Faye, an RoR server for asynchronous publishing and subscription that routes messages between clients.</span></p>
<h2><b>Chatbots</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you aren’t able to provide 24/7 live chat support, chatbots are often the next best thing. Chatbots can address simple user questions outside of normal business hours, and can also help direct users to the right customer service department before passing the conversation to a human agent. By automating the handling of routine queries, chatbots can save businesses </span><a href="https://chatbotsmagazine.com/how-with-the-help-of-chatbots-customer-service-costs-could-be-reduced-up-to-30-b9266a369945"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up to 30 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in customer service costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbots are a hot topic right now, which means that there’s no shortage of tutorials and resources available for them in Ruby on Rails. Since many businesses interact with their customers via their Facebook accounts, it makes sense to implement your chatbot over Facebook Messenger. The </span><a href="https://github.com/davidmann4/botstack"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“botstack”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project on GitHub is a base for building Messenger bots with Ruby on Rails. You can also follow along with Octane AI’s excellent two-part tutorial about RoR Messenger bots (</span><a href="https://chatbotsmagazine.com/bots-on-rails-part-one-looking-for-an-idea-and-setting-things-up-2e80e6526947"><span style="font-weight: 400;">part one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://chatbotsmagazine.com/bots-on-rails-part-two-building-conversational-flow-db096f6eceac"><span style="font-weight: 400;">part two</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<h2><b>Help Desk</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your customers have questions or problems that you can’t immediately address, you need to create a support ticket and add it to your IT help desk so that it can be resolved as soon as possible. By collecting information about your interactions with customers, you can more easily understand whether you’re properly handling issues in a timely manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most full-fledged help desk implementation in Ruby on Rails is </span><a href="https://getbrimir.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brimir</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an open source support ticket manager that allows you to send and receive emails within a user-friendly web interface. Incoming emails are converted into tickets to be assigned to support agents, and you can add automation rules for assigning tickets, adding labels, or sending notifications. Another open source ticket manager written in RoR is the </span><a href="https://github.com/bigfolio/big-help"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“BIG Help”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project on GitHub. </span></p>
<h2><b>Knowledge Base</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s even better than help desks and live chat, of course, is if customers are able to resolve their problems themselves by easily finding the answers they need. This is the point of self-service knowledge bases and FAQs, which allow users to browse issues by category and search for their specific problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve already started using the Brimir help desk system mentioned above, you’re in luck: the project also comes with its own simple knowledge base functionality. There are also several options for using open source Ruby gems within your existing RoR application, such as </span><a href="https://github.com/amuntasim/how_to"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how_to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://github.com/hyperoslo/knowledge_base"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowledge Base</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. how_to, for example, makes it easy to manage your website’s FAQs or manuals, including providing multilingual support.</span></p>
<h2><b>Customer Surveys</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running analytics on your help desk metrics can definitely help you gain some insights. In order to know that your customer support workflow is truly providing delightful experiences, however, you need to ask the people whose opinions matter most: your customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://github.com/NUBIC/surveyor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surveyor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ruby gem was originally designed for sending clinical research surveys, but can be adapted to work with a wide variety of surveys and questionnaires. Another open source Ruby gem for surveys is the appropriately-named </span><a href="https://github.com/runtimerevolution/survey"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which includes functionality for quizzes and contests. Finally, you can also work with </span><a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/automated-survey-ruby-rails"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twilio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do automated surveys with Ruby on Rails that can be answered via phone or SMS.</span></p>
<h2><b>Customer Portals</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your customers interact frequently with your website, or you provide an important service, it’s an excellent idea to provide a customer portal that they can access at any time. This portal should contain valuable information such as order history and status and interactions with customer support personnel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there are a number of content management systems built using Ruby on Rails that can be adapted to work as a customer portal for your website. </span><a href="http://radiantcms.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radiant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the most popular RoR CMS options, with an attractive user interface and a number of useful features such as templates and plugins. There’s also a healthy variety of alternatives, such as </span><a href="https://github.com/svenfuchs/adva_cms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adva CMS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.browsercms.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Browser CMS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if you’re looking for specific features or functionality.</span></p>
<h2><b>Final Thoughts</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing excellent support to your website’s users is crucial in order to build a base of happy customers who will keep returning to your business again and again. With a wealth of options when it comes to open source user-built gems, it’s hardly surprising that Ruby on Rails is such a popular choice for web developers. From chatbots to help desks and ticket support systems, finding the support tools you need for your Ruby on Rails web application has never been easier.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting your own business is tough</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—and even tougher when you aren’t sure what resources are available to assist you along the way. The good news is that if you’re struggling to market your startup or just need a place to begin, you’ve come to the right place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s saturated technology landscape, it’s no longer enough to rely just on the quality of your product to draw in new customers. Instead, the fate of your startup will rise and fall based on how effectively you convince clients that they need to do business with you through your marketing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making yourself stand out against your more established rivals is no easy task, so you’ll have to leverage a variety of tools that will give you a competitive edge. This guide will show you the most helpful and effective website tools for marketing your company and set you on the path to startup success.</span></p>
<h2><b>Analytics</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data is one of the most important currencies of the 21st century. By collecting, processing, and analyzing more data, you’ll obtain better information and use it to make better decisions for your company. As a business, you want to translate the data that you collect</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—from website visits to purchases—into actionable insights that tell you how to target customers and potential customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analytics tools measure metrics such as website traffic, page views, and clicks in order to assess the performance of your website and your marketing efforts. The data-driven solutions below will help you think like your audience by revealing their behavior and preferences.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/"><b>Google Analytics:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The website analytics tool of choice for companies of all sizes, Google Analytics provides a wide range of statistics about your website visitors. You can see valuable metrics such as bounce rate, average time on site, and percentage of new visitors.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.semrush.com/"><b>SEMrush:</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Not seeing the expected results from your inbound marketing campaign? SEMrush can analyze your search engine optimization (SEO) and pay-per-click (PPC) advertising initiatives to see where you’re going wrong and show you how you stack up against competitors.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/"><b>Crazy Egg:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you want to understand exactly how visitors use your website, Crazy Egg is exactly the tool you need. Crazy Egg uses simple visualizations to show you trends in how users scroll, click, and move their mouse, so that you can make improvements to your site’s design and content.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Help Desk</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your startup has customers, then it also needs tools for customer support to address the questions and complaints that you’ll inevitably receive. Although handling all these issues can be a challenge, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hink of them as a good sign that your business is growing!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most startups don’t have the resources to maintain a fully staffed help desk that’s available to customers 24/7. What you can do, however, is make use of the following established support tools and solutions, which will go a long way toward making your customers happy.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.helpscout.net/"><b>Help Scout:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you need a simple solution for ticket management, Help Scout may be your best bet. You can easily sort emails into mailboxes, folders, and categories and view your previous interactions with each customer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://osticket.com/"><b>osTicket:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A free, open source alternative to paid options like Help Scout, osTicket runs on your own servers and has a full-fledged suite of features, including filters for automated ticket routing, easy ticket transfer and locking, and dashboard analytics.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/"><b>ZenDesk:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One of the most popular choices for multichannel customer service and support tools, ZenDesk is a cloud-based SaaS (software as a service) product, allowing you to access it through browsers and mobile apps. The software has a simple installation and onboarding process and can even support users via social media, SMS, and chat.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Customer Relationship Management</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond addressing your customers’ immediate issues, you also need a way to connect with them and track their interactions with your company. By improving your relationships with your customer base, you’ll be more likely to have them come back and recommend you to their friends and professional connections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer relationship management (CRM) software can have a variety of capabilities, from social media engagement to sales automation, and you’ll have to decide which solution best fits your marketing strategy. Below, you’ll see some of our favorites.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/"><b>Salesforce:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Any discussion of CRM software would be incomplete without mentioning Salesforce, the reigning industry leader. Along with applications for sales, customer support, and commerce, Salesforce offers its all-in-one marketing platform Marketing Cloud and its marketing automation tool Pardot.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.insightly.com/"><b>Insightly:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you already use the Google Apps suite in your business operations, Insightly is the perfect solution for you. The software automatically locates your customers’ social media information, links it with your previous interactions and content, and displays it all within the Gmail interface.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.intercom.com/"><b>Intercom:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Need a way to automate your customer discovery process? Intercom lets you send targeted messages to customers and potential customers based on time or behavior, such as visiting your website or using your app. As an added bonus, there’s a discount for early-stage startups.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Newsletters</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email newsletters are some of the most powerful ways for you to market to customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—yet only a minority of your newsletter subscribers will open any given email. Unless you take the time to analyze how well your campaigns perform, you’ll simply be sending messages into the dark. To maximize your return on investment for your email marketing campaigns, take advantage of the following tools.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mailchimp.com/"><b>MailChimp:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MailChimp comes with a wealth of features, from drag-and-drop editing to analyzing the best time to send your emails. The service is free for the first 12,000 emails to 2,000 contacts, letting you try before you buy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.activecampaign.com/"><b>ActiveCampaign:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not only does ActiveCampaign include features for editing emails, it includes a full CRM and marketing automation suite. The insights you glean about your customers will allow you to strategically divide them based on relevant factors like interests, age, and location and then send better-targeted messages.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Chat</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One recent website marketing trend that’s potentially intriguing is the use of live chat tools. Potential buyers can speak with a real person who can answer questions for them while they browse the site. These tools have one massive upside: they allow you to engage visitors when they’re most interested in your products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live chat tools are both convenient for shoppers and growing in popularity. </span><a href="http://www.roosit.nl/files/en/documents/Forrester_making_proactive_chat_work.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a survey by Forrester Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 44 percent of customers say that having a live person answer questions for them while shopping is one of the most important features for a website.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.livechatinc.com/"><b>LiveChat:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> LiveChat has much to recommend it as a chat tool: from push notifications, to automated greetings and responses, to a “sneak peek” of what the customer is typing. Perhaps most importantly, LiveChat can show the customer’s previous chat history and recover automatically when you accidentally exit the chat.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.zopim.com/"><b>Zopim:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have an international customer base, Zopim is an excellent choice. The software automatically translates messages between the agent and the customer, and can also identify customers who are at key stages such as actively browsing or stuck at checkout.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Final Thoughts</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From analytics software to live chat tools, today’s startups are spoiled for choice in terms of marketing solutions. There are countless more options available than the ones we’ve highlighted above, so picking the right marketing solutions for your startup will require you to have a firm understanding of your own business needs and objectives.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of software development is full of trendy methodologies that offer to transform the way you work, bringing you greater efficiency and higher-quality products. One of the most influential philosophies in this “agile wave” has been lean software development.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re confused about lean or you need a quick introduction, you’re not the only one. Unlike many other methodologies, lean has been around for decades, although not always in the context of software development. Here’s a quick overview of the principles of lean and how businesses put it into practice today.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Lean Software Development?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean software development is an adaptation of the principles of the lean methodology as they apply to the field of software development. Although the ideas behind lean have been present since the early 20th century, the methodology as we know it today has its roots in the Toyota Production System of the 1970s, a system developed by Taiichi Ohno at Toyota that transformed the company into a worldwide automobile manufacturing powerhouse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term “lean software development” originates from the title of a 2003 book by Mary and Tom Poppendieck, who have done much to promote lean within the agile software development community. Although lean is closely affiliated with agile, however, and shares many of its underlying concepts, the two methodologies are distinct, as we’ll see in the next section.</span></p>
<h2><b>The 7 Principles of Lean Software Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean software development is founded on seven principles, which were originally used in the manufacturing industry but which are equally relevant for developing software. The seven principles are:</span></p>
<h3>1.Eliminate Waste </h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-191" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Lean-Step-1.png" alt="" width="694" height="255" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waste” refers to anything that does not directly add value to the final product. In software development, common sources of waste include unnecessary features or code, partially finished work, changes in requirements, delays in testing and bug fixing, overlapping responsibilities, and the failure to meet customers’ expectations.</span></p>
<h3><b>2.Build Quality In</b></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-192" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Lean-Step-2.png" alt="" width="694" height="255" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean principles are opposed to the traditional waterfall software development model, which mandates that testing is performed only after coding is complete. Instead, lean encourages developers to prevent defects in the first place, and to inspect the software at regular intervals in order to find any defects that have slipped through the cracks.</span></p>
<h3><b>3.Create Knowledge</b></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-193" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Lean-Step-3.png" alt="" width="694" height="255" /></p>
<p>Another conflict between waterfall and lean is lean’s focus on evolution and learning rather than adhering to rigid requirements, which are likely to change and don’t incorporate comments from users and key stakeholders. Developers should anticipate complexity and changes, emphasize the value of feedback, and frequently analyze their own processes to learn how they can do better.</p>
<h3><b>4.Defer Commitment</b></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-194" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Lean-Step-4.png" alt="" width="694" height="255" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like agile, lean prefers flexibility and keeping your options open. Practitioners of lean should delay making irreversible decisions for as long as possible—and not one moment longer. However, it’s just as important to make as many decisions reversible as possible, so that teams can avoid committing to a critical design decision that turns out to be a mistake.</span></p>
<h3><b>5.Deliver Fast</b></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-195" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Lean-Step-5.png" alt="" width="694" height="255" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speed is a major factor for organizations who want to abide by the previous four principles. Teams that move quicker can avoid waste, find defects faster, get more feedback, and delay decisions for longer. Companies that leverage time as a competitive advantage are often those who excel in their industries.</span></p>
<h3><b>6.Respect People</b></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-196" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Lean-Step-6.png" alt="" width="694" height="255" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although this principle sounds like common sense, it’s often easier said than done in the workplace. Respecting people is about having good leaders who inspire smart, technically minded team members to work under them. It also means empowering people with appropriate responsibilities and giving them the power to think and act for themselves.</span></p>
<h3><b>7.Optimize the Whole</b></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-197" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Lean-Step-7.png" alt="" width="694" height="255" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean organizations focus on the big picture—their entire value stream—rather than emphasizing a particular team or a quick fix that ends up backfiring. For example, in their rush to introduce a new critical feature, developers may inadvertently insert new bugs into the code base, creating more work for everyone later on.</span></p>
<h2><b>How Lean Software Development Works in Practice</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it clearly defines the seven principles above, lean software development does not prescribe any processes that must be followed in order for an organization to become lean. However, a number of common practices have emerged from lean organizations, many of which are also used in other agile methodologies.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Standup meetings:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Development teams meet daily in order to talk about their progress and suggest solutions to bugs, delays, or blocked flow. Recurring or serious issues may be discussed after the meeting by a smaller team and may result in a change to processes or tools.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Automation:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In order to move at a higher speed and reduce the risk of defects, automation is a crucial part of many organizations’ lean strategies. Automation can be used in testing, deployment, and code generation, among other areas.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Small batches:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lean requires work to be completed in “bite-size” pieces, a concept often referred to as “one-piece flow.” Features and bugs are tackled one at a time, requiring repeated releases and interactions with the business team in order to find new work.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Kanban:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A closely related practice to lean, kanban uses a system of cards on a board to visualize the current state of the project’s workflow. New cards (representing new work) are added to the board only when there is room for them.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>The Benefits of Lean Software Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations from tiny startups to massive Fortune 500 firms, including lean’s original birthplace of </span><a href="http://blog.crisp.se/2010/03/16/henrikkniberg/1268757660000"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toyota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have all used lean software development in order to deliver value and promote efficiency. Lean methods have won many converts for their advantages across the board. </span><a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Boost-productivity-with-lean-software-development"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a report by consulting firm McKinsey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, switching to lean software development can increase productivity by 20 to 40 percent within an organization, as well as lead to noticeable gains in quality and speed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean offers insights for identifying waste in your processes and for finding and anticipating issues. Under lean, teams are given more autonomy, allowing them to experiment, learn, and work on self-improvement. Projects are more collaborative, bringing developers and business teams together more frequently and with greater impact. The reason why lean has become so popular may be simple: smart, talented people are attracted to lean, and in turn lean attracts smart, talented people.</span></p>
