]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby On Rails</a>—commonly shortened to just Rails, is a powerful cross-platform software framework used widely for developing web applications. Could it also be a suitable platform for implementing various forms of biometric authentication? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As biometrics become more and more ubiquitous for verifying user identities as time goes on, it becomes an ever more important step to integrate such forms of authentication into web-based products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today we&#8217;re going to explore the feasibility of utilizing Rails for biometric authentication, along with a few additional considerations to keep in mind when taking on the task of doing so.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Few Notes On Biometric Authentication</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To properly explore this idea, we&#8217;ll first need to lay out what we mean by &#8220;biometric authentication.&#8221; In short, biometric authentication refers to a user identification/verification process that relies on biological input (the use of some part of the human body). This differs from both knowledge-based authentication (e.g. when a user must input a password or similar piece of information to access a system) and property-based authentication (e.g. when a user must rely on a keycard or other object to gain access).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Advantages Of Biometric Authentication</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it comes with some drawbacks, the advantages of using biometric authentication are still numerous. For starters, biometric authentication is considered one of the most effective forms of authentication currently available. This is because of the biological component. Unique, identifying physical features make them difficult to spoof, and the technology involved in authentication—fingerprint scanners, facial recognition, and the like—are highly accurate.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biometrics Examples</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few examples of biometric markers would include the aforementioned fingerprints and complete face, but might also include the human eye, voice, or even hand geometry. Each individual method of biometric authentication comes with its own set of unique advantages and disadvantages (some eye scanners, for example, can be fooled by high-quality photographs of a user&#8217;s face/eyes). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the whole, though, these forms of biometric authentication are lauded, and being incorporated in more and more pieces of technology. From hardware like smartphones and laptops to software such as web applications and services, the demand for biometrics has increased in recent years and will likely continue to do so as the means of implementing such means of authentication become even more affordable and reliable on a broad scale.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biometrics &amp; Web Services</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefit of using such technology for web services is evident. The quality and reliability of web products are enhanced when they are coupled with high degrees of information security, which is exactly what biometric authentication provides. By ensuring the users of web services are who they claim to be, personal data is protected and risks involved with the theft or abuse of said data are lessened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biometrics increase security by making it more difficult for potential intruders to gather the information they need to bypass safeguards. To have any hope of collecting biometric data from a target, they need to be within physical proximity, putting them at a greater risk of being discovered. If a biometric system is bypassed, the pool of potential suspects is limited to those who have personal access to the user, making the process of narrowing them down much easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the enhanced level of security, though, biometric authentication systems promote a greater ease of use for those utilizing a web-based platform. Just like fingerprint scanners and facial recognition on smartphones allow owners to swiftly and securely access their devices, the same principle can apply to using web applications. Instead of lengthy (and perhaps forgettable) passwords, users can rely on their biology to gain access to the systems and services they desire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, it can be used as a supplementary authentication factor as opposed to being the only one. In addition to a password or some similar knowledge-based piece of authentication, end users might also input their biometric info as an additional layer of security, making it even more difficult to an intruder to scam their way into a system.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Ruby On Rails Comes Into Play</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how does Ruby On Rails fit into this picture? Biometric recognition functionality has the be melded into a web application for it to provide the desired security benefits. Perhaps, for example, you want to implement some sort of facial recognition via webcam, or fingerprint scanning capability, or a combination of biometric systems to allow users access to your online platform. You&#8217;ll need to create code that allows for said integration to occur. Rails is a framework that provides one such option for developing the code required for this task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking the fingerprint scanning example a bit further, Rails can be used to create a system wherein end-users can register their fingerprint information via a fingerprint reader, then have that on file to access a specific web application. Through the internet, the end-users biometric input is read by an identification/authentication server, which has access to the database of registered users. If they&#8217;re &#8220;on the list,&#8221; so to speak, they are then authorized and can carry on with whatever business they intended to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This might be an authorization system of some sort, but could also be used in transaction systems (web platforms where users want to access monetary accounts), points-of-sale (where they may go online to purchase goods) or even time and attendance systems (logging when and where they are working). The uses for biometric authentication aren&#8217;t strictly limited to these options, mind you, but they are some of the most prevalent examples and provide solid examples of how this sort of authentication is most commonly used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The form of biometric input needn&#8217;t be limited to simply fingerprints either. As mentioned, it might also take the form of facial recognition, voice recognition, performing a biometric analysis of a user&#8217;s keyboard input, etc. As Rails is a popular framework for web development, particularly in instances where more complexity is required. It&#8217;s speed, modularity (it&#8217;s possible to integrate various 3rd-party solutions), and ability to allow for the addition of features to web applications (such as biometric authentication) make it a suitable choice for those wishing to include this type of authentication into their web products.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenges To Consider</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because something is possible, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a simple feat for just anyone to achieve. There are a few complexities to bear in mind when trying to implement biometric authentication via web applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Namely, finding a solution that will properly interface with the myriad biometric readers, scanners, and other peripherals used to capture biometric input. Additional concerns might be ensuring that such inputs (and the database in which end-users&#8217; data is stored) are kept secure, among several others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you aren&#8217;t experienced in developing Ruby On Rails apps, working with programmers who are will be paramount to tackling the challenge of using it to add biometric authentication to the web services that you envision. COAX has been working with Rails for years, and our developers are well-suited to the challenges that come with creating code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond that, though, we&#8217;re skilled with every phase of the development process and can assist with testing solutions to ensure they work as intended, along with maintaining them post-launch to patch defects and heighten their functionality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding biometric authentication to your web services is an excellent step towards increasing their security and promoting greater ease for your end users. We&#8217;re available to help support you in achieving that goal. </p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruby on Rails is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a high-quality, highly popular back-end web development framework. By now, the RoR framework has developed into a powerful technology with a number of benefits, including its speed of deployment, pre-built modules and plugins, and user-friendly community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to build an enterprise-strength, outward-facing website with RoR, however, you need a way to provide support to your customers. By making the right choices in terms of customer service, you’ll both keep your existing users happier and turn more people from prospects into loyal converts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From live chat to help desk systems, there are a number of ways that companies can organize support for their Ruby on Rails web applications. Here’s a look at six of your most popular options.</span></p>
<h2><b>Live Chat</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live chat is an essential part of any business website that serves clients in many different locations. According to Ubisend’s </span><a href="https://insights.ubisend.com/2016-mobile-messaging-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 Mobile Messaging Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 51 percent of customers want businesses to be able to respond to them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What’s more, Zendesk’s </span><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/company/press/zendesk-benchmark-live-chat-drives-highest-customer-satisfaction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2015 Benchmark report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that live chat results in the most satisfied customers (92 percent of them), beating other channels such as email, phone, and social media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Ruby on Rails’ strong user community, there are several accessible online tutorials for building RoR live chat applications. Three of them, from </span><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/create-a-chat-app-with-rails-5-actioncable-and-devise/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SitePoint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2016/07/14/building-customer-service-chat-rails-5-action-cable-sms-dr/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexmo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://blog.heroku.com/real_time_rails_implementing_websockets_in_rails_5_with_action_cable"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroku</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, make use of the new Action Cable feature in Rails 5, which allows you to communicate in real time over WebSockets. Another tutorial from </span><a href="http://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/hello-or-building-a-chatting-app-with-rails/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Code Adventure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> development blog uses Faye, an RoR server for asynchronous publishing and subscription that routes messages between clients.</span></p>
<h2><b>Chatbots</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you aren’t able to provide 24/7 live chat support, chatbots are often the next best thing. Chatbots can address simple user questions outside of normal business hours, and can also help direct users to the right customer service department before passing the conversation to a human agent. By automating the handling of routine queries, chatbots can save businesses </span><a href="https://chatbotsmagazine.com/how-with-the-help-of-chatbots-customer-service-costs-could-be-reduced-up-to-30-b9266a369945"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up to 30 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in customer service costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbots are a hot topic right now, which means that there’s no shortage of tutorials and resources available for them in Ruby on Rails. Since many businesses interact with their customers via their Facebook accounts, it makes sense to implement your chatbot over Facebook Messenger. The </span><a href="https://github.com/davidmann4/botstack"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“botstack”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project on GitHub is a base for building Messenger bots with Ruby on Rails. You can also follow along with Octane AI’s excellent two-part tutorial about RoR Messenger bots (</span><a href="https://chatbotsmagazine.com/bots-on-rails-part-one-looking-for-an-idea-and-setting-things-up-2e80e6526947"><span style="font-weight: 400;">part one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://chatbotsmagazine.com/bots-on-rails-part-two-building-conversational-flow-db096f6eceac"><span style="font-weight: 400;">part two</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<h2><b>Help Desk</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your customers have questions or problems that you can’t immediately address, you need to create a support ticket and add it to your IT help desk so that it can be resolved as soon as possible. By collecting information about your interactions with customers, you can more easily understand whether you’re properly handling issues in a timely manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most full-fledged help desk implementation in Ruby on Rails is </span><a href="https://getbrimir.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brimir</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an open source support ticket manager that allows you to send and receive emails within a user-friendly web interface. Incoming emails are converted into tickets to be assigned to support agents, and you can add automation rules for assigning tickets, adding labels, or sending notifications. Another open source ticket manager written in RoR is the </span><a href="https://github.com/bigfolio/big-help"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“BIG Help”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project on GitHub. </span></p>
<h2><b>Knowledge Base</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s even better than help desks and live chat, of course, is if customers are able to resolve their problems themselves by easily finding the answers they need. This is the point of self-service knowledge bases and FAQs, which allow users to browse issues by category and search for their specific problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve already started using the Brimir help desk system mentioned above, you’re in luck: the project also comes with its own simple knowledge base functionality. There are also several options for using open source Ruby gems within your existing RoR application, such as </span><a href="https://github.com/amuntasim/how_to"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how_to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://github.com/hyperoslo/knowledge_base"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowledge Base</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. how_to, for example, makes it easy to manage your website’s FAQs or manuals, including providing multilingual support.</span></p>
<h2><b>Customer Surveys</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running analytics on your help desk metrics can definitely help you gain some insights. In order to know that your customer support workflow is truly providing delightful experiences, however, you need to ask the people whose opinions matter most: your customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://github.com/NUBIC/surveyor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surveyor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ruby gem was originally designed for sending clinical research surveys, but can be adapted to work with a wide variety of surveys and questionnaires. Another open source Ruby gem for surveys is the appropriately-named </span><a href="https://github.com/runtimerevolution/survey"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which includes functionality for quizzes and contests. Finally, you can also work with </span><a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/automated-survey-ruby-rails"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twilio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do automated surveys with Ruby on Rails that can be answered via phone or SMS.</span></p>
<h2><b>Customer Portals</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your customers interact frequently with your website, or you provide an important service, it’s an excellent idea to provide a customer portal that they can access at any time. This portal should contain valuable information such as order history and status and interactions with customer support personnel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there are a number of content management systems built using Ruby on Rails that can be adapted to work as a customer portal for your website. </span><a href="http://radiantcms.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radiant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the most popular RoR CMS options, with an attractive user interface and a number of useful features such as templates and plugins. There’s also a healthy variety of alternatives, such as </span><a href="https://github.com/svenfuchs/adva_cms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adva CMS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.browsercms.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Browser CMS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if you’re looking for specific features or functionality.</span></p>
<h2><b>Final Thoughts</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing excellent support to your website’s users is crucial in order to build a base of happy customers who will keep returning to your business again and again. With a wealth of options when it comes to open source user-built gems, it’s hardly surprising that Ruby on Rails is such a popular choice for web developers. From chatbots to help desks and ticket support systems, finding the support tools you need for your Ruby on Rails web application has never been easier.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Working through a great variety of <a href="https://coaxsoft.com/development/ruby-on-rails.html">Ruby on Rails</a> projects in COAX Software, we try to keep a hand on a pulse of technologies, so we all here are big fans of solutions that simplify life in a user &#8211; customer &#8211; development agency triangle.<span id="more-149"></span></p>
<p>Our development team gathered 5 recent fresh gems for Ruby, you should think of trying in a project.</p>
<p>So one by one:</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders">Secure Headers</a></h2>
<p>Content Security Policy (CSP) is an HTTP response header that restricts the browser to loading external assets such as scripts, styles or media from a wide variety of sources — as well as inline scripts. The reason why it exists &#8211; to prevent code injections, XSS(Cross site scripting), click-jacking.</p>
<p>The main idea of Secure Headers gem for Ruby on Rails is to defense against XSS and other content-based injection attacks and do it centralized and easy to configure way.</p>
<p>If you want to test your web application or website you can use https://securityheaders.io/ website.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman">Brakeman</a></h2>
<p>This gem is more analysis tool to check app for security vulnerabilities, security scanner.<br />
 The biggest benefit that it’s analyzing your code, not only what your server sends to your visitor’s browser. And it doesn’t require any configuration, so it’s ready from the box to be used.<br />
 After scanning you’ll get a nice report with possible issues found. Guys from Brakeman also has a Pro Subscription, which includes even more benefits that open source version.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/Shopify/identity_cache">Identity cache</a></h2>
<p>Initially developed &amp; then open sourced by Shopify team, this gem specifies how you want to cache your model objects, and add a bunch of convenience methods for accessing those objects through the cache.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/taskrabbit/makara">Makara</a></h2>
<p>Working on big web applications, like those we develop here in COAX, require using database replication. It includes a master database and multiple replicas called slaves. The master &amp; slaves database have same data and the schema and are always kept in a consistent state.</p>
<p>One on core ideas it that all writes and updates must take place on the master. Reads may take place on one or more slaves, which is done due to speed increase.</p>
<p>Makara is a tool to manage those master/slave connections.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/collectiveidea/interactor">Interactor</a></h2>
<p>Interactor provides a common interface for performing complex user interactions.<br />
 It’s a simple, single-purpose object. Interactors are used to encapsulate your application&#8217;s business logic. Generally, interactor represents one thing that your application does.</p>

 </b></em></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em><b>Thomas Alva Edison</b></em></span></p>
<h2><strong>Second Year</strong></h2>
<p>So here’s the second year of our development path. A quick look at what we’ve already covered: services, commanders, presenters, query. In the second year, a number of issues are already resolved and the process moves smoothly. One day you get a feeling “I should rewrite everything” and you start paying attention to more serious architectural decisions. So you come to:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Знімок-екрана-2017-07-12-о-18.10.33.png" alt="" width="602" height="317" /></p>
<p>Firstly, let’s find out what is it?<br />
 <a href="http://trailblazer.to/">Trailblazer</a> is a high-level architecture for web applications, not just for Rails. It gives you a high-level architecture, extends the basic MVC pattern with new abstractions. Trailblazer gently enforces encapsulation, an intuitive code structure and gives you an object-oriented architecture. Well, Trailblazer is all about structure. It helps re-organize existing code into smaller components where different concerns are handled in separated classes, so you can pick which layers you want. Trailblazer completely pulls the business out of the framework so that there is only HTTP and nothing more. It doesn&#8217;t impose technical implementations, it offers mature solutions for recurring problems in all types of Rails applications. </p>
<p>The author of Trailblazer is Nick Sutterer, on the Internet known as <a href="https://github.com/apotonick">@apotonick</a>. Those who have already felt the pain of fast-growing projects, realize what idea Nick tries to bring to us all.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Знімок-екрана-2017-07-12-о-18.06.55.png" alt="" width="498" height="307" /></p>
<p>“Nick visited Lviv (Ukraine) and was a speaker at <a href="https://pivorak.com/">Pivorak</a>. He’s really talkative, funny and cool man, we spent awesome time together”- Volodya Sveredyuk</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Знімок-екрана-2017-07-12-о-18.07.18.png" alt="" width="486" height="380" /></p>
<p>In Trailblazer everything moves around the operations: the contact with models get permits thus validate data through contact. Another thing that we really like is cells, very cool view layer for Rails. In Cells, you work with views as with Ruby objects that can render one little template and that’s it. You have no global state, as all methods for object definition are available in this template. Actually, this is very similar to React. We leave the link on React, so you can compare.</p>
<p>  Some operations of the Trailblazer’s work:</p>
<p><img src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Знімок-екрана-2017-07-12-о-18.07.40.png" alt="" width="355" height="429" /></p>
<p>
 In Trailblazer everything is resolved around the steps, these steps are used without Ifs. You declare steps, Trailblazer searches for the methods in this object and execute them. For example, if you have “false” returned, then it is a bad step failure. The whole operation, which we’ve creates as an object always gives us a result. That is, we can explain all business logic without Ifs.</p>
<p><img src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Знімок-екрана-2017-07-12-о-18.07.50.png" alt="" width="588" height="290" /><br />
 Another positive thing about Trailblazer is the change of concepts.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Знімок-екрана-2017-07-12-о-18.07.59.png" alt="" width="456" height="408" /><br />
 Concepts are something like domain objects. When your application is growing, it is still in parallel cluttered with a bunch of operations. In Trailblazer you have a button Concepts where the basic objects are held. Already inside every concept, you see what must be inside it. In this way, you better understand the architecture, what’s happening inside it, what can be also added.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Знімок-екрана-2017-07-12-о-17.24.12.png" alt="" width="597" height="333" /></p>
<p>Trailblazer 2 saw the world this year. It differs a bit from the first version. In version 2.1 of Trailblazer, the method called flow is added. It shows how to follow the whole operation, all the steps from the beginning. This greatly simplifies our life, because it is possible to track at what point something went wrong. Thus help to solve the issue faster and move further.</p>
<h2><strong>Third Year</strong></h2>
<p>Over the time, on the third or fourth year in development everything comes down to a bad code and there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it, especially if you work alone on the project. Whatever architecture you have, it worths nothing if you don&#8217;t stick to the primarily chosen strategy.</p>
<p>There’s one book we highly recommend you to read <a href="https://airbrake.io/blog/software-design/domain-driven-design">“Domain Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software”</a> written by programmer Eric Evans and published in 2004.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Знімок-екрана-2017-07-12-о-18.08.22.png" alt="" width="563" height="376" /></p>
<p>DDD is the expansion upon and application of the domain concept, as it applies to the development of software. It aims to ease the creation of complex applications by connecting the related pieces of the software into an ever-evolving model. DDD focuses on three core principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on the core domain and domain logic.</li>
<li>Base complex designs on models of the domain.</li>
<li>Constantly collaborate with domain experts, in order to improve the application model and resolve any emerging domain-related issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eric has successfully described why you should not put all goods you gather in one application. He described why you should study and understand the sphere you work in and then adapt the code to the sphere, not vice versa. Talking less, the book is complicated but very cool and worth reading.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Знімок-екрана-2017-07-12-о-18.08.30.png" alt="" width="610" height="190" /><br />
 And one more thing left for today &#8211; <a href="http://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html">Microservices</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Знімок-екрана-2017-07-12-о-18.08.41.png" alt="" width="620" height="368" /><br />
 Microservices is a variant of the service-oriented architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity and makes the application easier to understand, develop and test. It also parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently. Microservices also allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring. Microservices-based architectures enable continuous delivery and deployment. You should never start your project with them. If you have gone back and forth through all routes of Ruby you’ll understand that there are cases when Ruby is not suitable. So you should write a service that solves the problem from the edges to the center.</p>
<p> AND final recommendation: always strive to remain flexible and fast, not cool!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em><b>“Your time is limited, so don&#8217;t waste it living someone else&#8217;s life. “</b></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em><b>Steve Jobs.</b></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Wasting no more minute let’s get down to study what Ruby on Rails is. Perhaps it’s the perfect framework for you to learn. Let’s go! What is Ruby on Rails? Ruby on Rails or RoR is a web framework written in the Ruby programming language. Sometimes people not very familiar with Rails say: “Do you know the Rails language?” Friends, Rails is not a programming language, it’s a web framework for web application development. RoR framework was invented by David Heinemeier- Hansson at Basecamp in 2004 and became increasingly more popular, being used by other successful internet firms like Hulu, Shopify, AirBnB, Twitter etc.<br />

<p>There is one huge benefit of Rails &#8211; it allows us to add new features to a project quickly. Quite useful, but it can play a bad trick. Velocity in the development is the problem of all technologies, but Ruby on Rails is a true victim of its availability, ease, speed. Very often we just forget to think about different ways of solving an issue and arrive nowhere. In this article we’ll overview the Advanced Rails Architecture journey from the very first day in details. Welcome on board!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-24 size-full" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.51.34.png" alt="" width="593" height="153" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.51.34.png 593w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.51.34-300x77.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  The theme of rails Architecture is very complex. Actually, Rails is a really cool framework. However, from time to time we can observe flaming, blaming and throwing mud at Rails in the developer community. But in fact, someone has written bad code, and blames Rails for his failure. Personally, we’ve learned how to use Rails and are able to find an elegant and failure-proof solution fast to almost any problem, or feature-request. Interesting to learn how? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The whole architecture of Rails builds upon the concept of a monolithic application, as opposed to microservice architecture, which splits single applications into multiple shards of small apps which are intertwined. The basis architecture that Rails provides us with is MVC: Model, View, Controller. MVC is present in a lot of frameworks which are used to develop user-facing applications, Rails just popularized this approach alongside with Python’s Django outside of the enterprise world, because it is a very simple approach to application design. The </span><b>M</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">odel </span><b>V</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">iew </span><b>C</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">ontroller principle divides the work of an application into three separate but closely cooperative subsystems.<br />
 <img class="aligncenter wp-image-25 size-full" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.51.47.png" alt="" width="577" height="362" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.51.47.png 577w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.51.47-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" /><br />
 </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Model &#8211; is responsible for work with the data: we insert data into the database or retrieve information via SQL or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ActiveRecord</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Rails’ layer on top of SQL. Model provides an interface and binding between the tables in a relational database and the Ruby program code that manipulates database records.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">View &#8211; it is a presentation of data in a particular format, triggered by a controller&#8217;s decision to present the data. They are script-based template systems like JSP, ASP, PHP, and very easy to integrate with AJAX technology.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Controller &#8211; This is where the actual HTTP request by the client is handled: a typical controller action delegates database-related logic to a Model and user interface logic to a View with respect to the format requested by the client &#8211; HTML, XML or JSON for example. In other words, Controller it’s facility within the application that directs traffic, on the one hand, querying the models for specific data, and on the other hand, organizing that data (searching, sorting, massaging it) into a form that fits the needs of a given view.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  On this stage a question arise: where should we include business logic? Every app is about business, not about the code, isn’t it? Business gives us money and we write code. That is a sequence, not vice versa. Developers new to MVC application design might assume it is put in the controller, because this is the point of entry/exit in the application. So, a task of a seasoned developer might be refactoring a messy and fat controller. Take a quick look at this sample:<br />
 <img class="aligncenter wp-image-26 " src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.52.01.png" alt="" width="537" height="379" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.52.01.png 594w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.52.01-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" /><br />
 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  This is a real screenshot from a project which we’ve dealt with. The fact it’s a project that earns millions of dollars, makes us think that the case is not in the code quality. This is our IDE (Integrated development environment). The piece of code pictured in the screenshot is called the Controller. Okay, what&#8217;s the matter? You can observe 137 lines in the IDE (the code is blurred, no need to gaze).  We purposely сompressed the code, there is a special method in the controller called Create. This method takes 137 lines (77 controller methods) and we have 1024 lines. How did this happen?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  We reached this amount of lines because we were not taught where to put the business logic in a timely manner. You may be suggested: take logic from Controller &#8211; put it in the Model. Meanwhile, the application grows bigger and we can keep fat Models organized by using mixins or extract business logic to POROs (plain old ruby objects). How the latter can be done nicely is described in the following.</span></p>
<h2><b>  Service Objects</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  In the first year of life of your application, the simplest thing you, as the tech-lead on the project, can do, is to enforce the use of architectural patterns in order to increase code quality. The pattern Service Object is known to all, in all languages and technologies. Patterns migrate between technologies, and visit Rails as well. The simplest thing you can do, is to extract shared or complex logic to newly introduced service objects, in order to keep the model layer organized.<br />
 <img class="wp-image-29 size-full aligncenter" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.52.40.png" alt="" width="553" height="324" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.52.40.png 553w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.52.40-300x176.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" /><br />
 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  If you open Wikipedia, you will find the definition of a Service Object. When some operation is happening in the business part of an application and it operates with several different data models, services are exactly what you need.</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-30 size-full aligncenter" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.52.53.png" alt="" width="568" height="325" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.52.53.png 568w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.52.53-300x172.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The service object pattern is simple, it is an object that has one method (default name would be call conventionally). This method accepts certain data, it’ll be good to accept hashes, because it&#8217;ll make the data easier to validate. On the screenshot above you can see the scheme of operations &#8211; what needs to be done.</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-31 size-full aligncenter" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.53.05.png" alt="" width="554" height="396" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.53.05.png 554w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.53.05-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  And now an example of a controller, where the story begins &#8211; the innocent controller, which subsequently turns into 170 lines, sometimes it happens. It is very popular when it comes to the integration with external services. The picture is an example of the integration of the payment system Stripe: we determine the amount of the payment, the customer starts to do something, charge, do a redirect, rescue (for example if the card has not passed). Everything seems fine, the real troubles begin when we meet conditions (if, unless). Basing on the code above, we want to do a check out page, something like this:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-32 size-full" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.54.10.png" alt="" width="534" height="188" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.54.10.png 534w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.54.10-300x106.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px" /><br />
 Clean Ruby code that resolves everything.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-33 size-full" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.54.19.png" alt="" width="591" height="157" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.54.19.png 591w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.54.19-300x80.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  So, you’ve been continuously developing your project for one year. You understand, that software architecture can’t be compared to normal architecture, the matter of building solid structures that are meant to not be changed for centuries. If software architecture is not flexible, and you cannot easily change it, it is bad architecture. The criterion of good architecture, is the ability to make changes to the application quickly and flexibly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  After the first year of development you will have an incredibly large number of services. Among basic: SOLID, DRY and KISS. We will talk more about this principles in the next articles. So you&#8217;re moving further and your file folder has become significant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">   On the one hand, it is more than clear, that using only the services pattern is not sufficient. And you expand a project folder to such size:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-35 " src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.55.18.png" alt="" width="431" height="695" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.55.18.png 369w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.55.18-186x300.png 186w" sizes="(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Note</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: models, views, controllers and services are there too.</span></p>
<h2><b>  Levels Of Indirections</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Developers often make a common mistake, which is described by the concept of levels of indirection. Levels of indirection is the process, when the layers of your application start to become redundant. We reccomend you to try to avoid this during the first year of development. As your application grows, you can&#8217;t know in advance what you will need in the future. Wait until your services will grow to the point where they become crowded. Then you will be able to group your services layers by function and maintain a set of different service layers, each representing an abstract and commonly used function.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span><b>Progressive Enhancement</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  We are proponents of the approach called progressive enhancement &#8211; a gradual complication of the software architecture. What if you try to keep your app simple, as long as you can, and complicate only when your team encounters or anticipate problems with increased code complexity? You will surely benefit from it. As the the practice shows, sophisticated architecture can be made very simple. It’s a difficult task to make the architecture easy to understand, flexible and changeable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Take a look at the following screenshot:<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  As you may see, MVC is described as the HTTP level in the screen above. On the business level, when the services become large in number, the first thing you need to think about is separations of concerns. Here you can see, while queries are responsible for fetching data from the database, operations can alter data and emit destructive actions like email delivery. Policies are for enabling business requirements by enabling business logic validation.  For example: A policy would check for how many users are registered already and how many are allowed to sign up. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-38 size-full" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.56.14.png" alt="" width="501" height="222" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.56.14.png 501w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.56.14-300x133.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Over time, you will feel that you do not want to repeat the same actions and will need something different to use. At this stage, various third-party libraries, that help to organize the business logic come to the rescue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  There are many libraries to be found in the width of the Internet, among my favorites is Active Interaction.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/orgsync/active_interaction">Active Interaction</a></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-88 aligncenter" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/active-interaction.png" alt="" width="1023" height="612" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/active-interaction.png 1023w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/active-interaction-768x459.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  This is a library that implements service oriented design partially, while an interaction is the combination of an operation and business logic requirements like seen in policies.<br />
 <img class="aligncenter wp-image-40 size-full" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.56.36.png" alt="" width="522" height="338" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.56.36.png 522w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.56.36-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px" /><br />
 </span></p>
<p>Another decently popular library, implementing service oriented design, is <a href="https://github.com/andypike/rectify">Rectify</a>, which is bigger compared to ActiveInteraction.<br />
 <img class="size-medium wp-image-89 aligncenter" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rectify-ruby-1024x631.png" alt="" width="1024" height="631" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rectify-ruby-1024x631.png 1024w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rectify-ruby-768x474.png 768w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rectify-ruby.png 1038w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Rectify introduces 4 new software design layers:<br />
 <img class="aligncenter wp-image-42 size-full" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.57.00.png" alt="" width="389" height="215" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.57.00.png 389w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.57.00-300x166.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /><br />
 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Forms are responsible for validation. Commands are comparable to operations. Presenter &#8211; is partly responsible for the view. Query &#8211; responsible for data retrieval. If you use Rectify, your controller will look like this:<br />
 <img class="aligncenter wp-image-43 size-full" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.57.10.png" alt="" width="534" height="346" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.57.10.png 534w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.57.10-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px" /><br />
 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">   You can observe an example of Rectify used within a controller in the screenshot above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  When you observe the create action, you pass user input from the params hash provided by Rails to a newly instantiated form. Take a look:<br />
 <img class="aligncenter wp-image-44 size-full" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.57.24.png" alt="" width="577" height="281" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.57.24.png 577w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-14.57.24-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" /><br />
 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  The form will validate everything and perform all the necessary processes. That is, all errors with user input regarding business logic can be forwarded to the form. This is convenient because it can be reused between view, API and so on.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-46 size-full" src="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-18.03.35.png" alt="" width="341" height="554" srcset="https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-18.03.35.png 341w, https://coaxsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Знімок-екрана-2017-06-27-о-18.03.35-185x300.png 185w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  The form is then passed to a command, taking care of actually performing validations on the form. In case the provided data is valid, the command will execute potentially destructive actions like email delivery or changes to the database. This example makes use of a transaction, which makes sure all previous actions are rolled back, in case one of the actions fails.</span></p>
